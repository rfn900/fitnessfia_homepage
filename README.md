# New homepage to fitnessfia.com

This ongoing project is part of the full redesign of the fitnessfia blog - check
the current status live at https://fitnessfia.com/home

The homepage is done using Tailwindcss as a Postcss plugin.

It is deployed in a Wordpress site as a fully custom coded page. This was
achieved by forking the blank_page wordpress plugin and turning it into a plugin
that allows me to ship custom code without messing with the original theme.

I will later be developing this fork further to create a full CLI app to
facilitate the development and shipping of custom code to a wordpress blog.
